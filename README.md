# PSYC757 Spring 2022 - Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

We need to re-conceptualize how we collectively think about statistics.  Bayesian methods are merely a vehicle for doing that re-conceptualization.  I will walk you through the following bits:

1. How this course differs from my past iterations
2. How the text offers you useful but often deep insights that you may already know (but you don't know you knew them)
3. How to navigate R, Rstudio, stan, rstan, and coding in general
4. How to apply probability language in code

To do so, you need to install R, Rstudio, and rstan.  I **highly** recommend you install the latest and greatest versions of each:

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org)
* [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
* [rstan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

Most of the material will exist on GitHub.  I recommend you sign up for a free account and follow [my repository for the course](https://github.com/pem725/PSYC757-Spring2022)

Getting Rstudio and GitHub to cooperate can be tricky.  I strongly encourage you to use it regularly so you can become accustomed to having version control with your code.  You will thank me later.  For the *best* and perhaps only good guide for getting started, please check out this [handy resource](https://happygitwithr.com/).
